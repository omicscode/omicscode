I work at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poznań Poland as a part of a very good team. I work as area expert and responsible for genomic analysis and software development from illumina and long read sequencing. I work using Python, R, RUST, Typescript and I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning as an Area Expert area for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all domains of life covering plant, bacterial, fungal and humans.

Scientific and Bio-Computing Areas of Interest: 
🧬 I am specific to the genomics area such as RNA-seq, single cell genomics, and any genomics or protein language models and biological deep bio ML 🧬 and bio-software. 
❌ I don't do protein structural modelling, and ML on the same.
❌ What i don't code anymore: C++ since 2021 (2010-2021), dropped DevOPS and Golang (2024). 

🧬 Sequencing specifics: \
2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi 🧬 RNASeq, GenomSeq, Phylogenomics, PacBio Sequencing, Single Cell Analysis, Bio-software. 👨‍💻 \
2021:2023: Machine Learning, Bio-software. 🧬 \
2024: PanGenome, Bio-software. \
2025: Human Genomics 🧬and Bio-software, Mobile Bio-software 🧬 

🧬 Language stack: I am very specific and oritented toward taking typed languages over the others. My language stack has been dominated by the typed languages and you can find below:
Software Development: C++ (2010-2021) and now I use RUST. 
Web Mobile Development: RUST, Typescript and React and React Native/Expo. 
Bioinformatics Data Analysis: Python, R. 
Blockchain Healthcare: RUST,Javascript and Python. 

🧬 Language categorization: I have categorized every language for specific purposes, so that i can use the maximum use of the same. I dont do web programming in Python such as Django and other web frameworks in Python. Similarly in R, i dont do Shiny and hence only used Python and R for deep learning and machine learning purposes.This catgorial distincttion for each language allows me to use the maximum benefit of what language has to offer and in-demand according to the latest development.
