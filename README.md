I work at Instytut Chemii  Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poznań Poland as a part of a very good team. I work as area expert and responsible for genomic analysis and software development from illumina and long read sequencing. I work using Python, R, RUST, Typescript at I provide  bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning  as an Area Expert area for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies  across all domains of life covering plant, bacterial, fungal and humans. I use Python and R (data  analysis and web), RUST (system programming and bio-software) and Typescript and React (Web and Mobile SDK). 

Areas of Interest: ▶️ I am specific to the genomics area such as RNA-seq, single cell genomics, and any genomics or protein language models and biological deep bio ML 🧬 and bio-software. ❌ I don't do protein structural modelling, and ML on the same.
