🧬 genomicssport: I work at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poznań Poland as area expert of a very good team and responsible for genomic analysis and software development for illumina and long read sequencing approaches. I provide bio-software development, algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies across all species. What i do and what i have done is outlaid below including classification of the programming languages for each task, so that you can have a broader idea of what you are looking into and what i extend.

🧬 Scientific and Bio-Computing Areas of Interest: I am specific to the genomics area such as RNA-seq and Single cell, Genomics or Protein language models and biological machine and deep learning 🧬 and bio-software.

🧬 Sequencing specifics: \
2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi 🧬 RNASeq, GenomSeq, Phylogenomics, PacBio Sequencing, Single Cell Analysis, Bio-software. \
2021:2023: Machine Learning, Bio-software. 🧬 \
2024: PanGenome, Bio-software.🧬 \
2025: Human Genomics🧬and Bio-software,Mobile and Blockchain Healthcare🧬

🧬 Software Development:C++(2010-2021), 2024: RUST. \
🧬 Web/Solana Development: RUST, React \
🧬 Bioinformatics/Data Analysis/Machine and Deep Learning: Python 

🧬 Research and Topics and areas, I follow on X (previously Twitter).You will find the same on my GitHub account:
1. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology including data science 🧬.
2. Programming languages and tooling associated with the same,
3. Genomics 🧬 algorithms, Machine and deep learning.

🧬 Research and Topics and areas, I dont work, read and explore: DevOPS, IOT and System Design and Management, GeoInformatics or Machine Learning.

🧬 See the commit tag as final or build release for the release.
